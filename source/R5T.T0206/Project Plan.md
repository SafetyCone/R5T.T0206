# R5T.T0206
Strictly framework-typed complex data types library for Visual Studio (MSBuild) XML project file types. (netstandard2.1)

Contains data types modeling things like:

	* COM references

That are complex data types, but with properties that are strictly framework-typed.

This library is strictly framework-typed, so it can only depend on:

	* netstandard2.1
	* R5T.T0142 - Type marker attribute type library.
